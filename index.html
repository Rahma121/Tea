	<p> At the very least, tea is a flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day. On top of that, studies have shown teas can help protect your teeth and your heart</p>

	<h2 style="color:orange"> INGREDIENTS </h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li> Tea bag </li>
		<li> Water  </li>
		<li> Milk - Dairy/Plant-based (Optional) </li>
		<li> Sugar/Honey (Optional) </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h2 style="color:orange"> PREPARTION </h2>
	
	<ol>
		<li> Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour! 
	</li>
		<li> Pop a tea bag into your mug (<em> always </em> a big mug) 
	</li>
		<li> Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly. 
	</li>
		<li> Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations. 
	</li>
		<li> Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter. 
	</li>
		<li> If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.
	</li>
		<li> Enjoy! </li>
	</ol>
